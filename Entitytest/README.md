# EntityTest
Testing the new Display entities in Minecraft 1.19.4

## To test this plugin: 
- put a schema (SPONGE format) in the plugin folder (/plugins/EntityTest/)
- then the 2 commands to execute will be the following: 

### Display the schema :
- /mide create *name* your_schema.schem 2 2 2 2
(*name* is your schema identifier, "your_schema.schem" is the schema, and 2 2 2 are the vector coordinates)

### Try to move it smoothly:
- /mide move *name*
(*name* is the id of your schema)
