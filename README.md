## What is Lumy-API?
The Lumy-API project allows the QuillCraft server to easily update text stored in Redis via local or non-local requests combined with a specific port to connect to the Lumy server. 

## How to configure it?
- The Lumy server connection port can be changed in the **config-lumy.yml** configuration file.
- The text files are in YAML format and are named according to the iso assigned to the language of the text contained in the file *(example: English (USA) -> en_us, French -> fr_fr)*.
